This project intends to create a framework and a GUI for
controlling Ace3P[1] jobs - including geometry/mesh generation from template
CUBIT[2] scripts, managing all the input/output files, controlling remote jobs
on HPC resources such as hopper2[3] at NERSC, and running analysis and plots
on the solutions.

To use the code, you need
 (1) Password-less SSH access to Hopper2
 (2) Enter your username and location of acdtool executable in file
        src/acdOpti/AcdOptiSettings.py
 (3) The following non-standard-library python packages:
        pyGTK, paramiko, CUBIT
