This project is a framework and a GUI for controlling Ace3P [1] jobs -- including geometry/mesh generation from template CUBIT [2] scripts, managing all the input/output files, controlling remote jobs on HPC resources such as hopper2[3] at NERSC, and running analysis and plots on the solutions.
The program and it's use is described in [5] and [6].

To use the code, you need
 (1) Password-less SSH access to Hopper2
 (2) Enter your username and location of acdtool executable in file
        src/acdOpti/AcdOptiSettings.py
 (3) The following non-standard-library python packages:
        pyGTK, paramiko, CUBIT
